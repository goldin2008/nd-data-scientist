### Project: Disaster Response Pipelines
==Project Overview==

In this course, you've learned and built on your data engineering skills to expand your opportunities and potential as a data scientist. In this project, you'll apply these skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

In the Project Workspace, you'll find a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. You will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

Your project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. This project will show off your software skills, including your ability to create basic data pipelines and write clean, organized code!

Below are a few screenshots of the web app.

Project Components
There are three components you'll need to complete for this project.

1. ETL Pipeline
In a Python script, process_data.py, write a data cleaning pipeline that:

Loads the messages and categories datasets
Merges the two datasets
Cleans the data
Stores it in a SQLite database
2. ML Pipeline
In a Python script, train_classifier.py, write a machine learning pipeline that:

Loads data from the SQLite database
Splits the dataset into training and test sets
Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
Outputs results on the test set
Exports the final model as a pickle file
3. Flask Web App
We are providing much of the flask web app for you, but feel free to add extra features depending on your knowledge of flask, html, css and javascript. For this part, you'll need to:

Modify file paths for database and model as needed
Add data visualizations using Plotly in the web app. One example is provided for you
Github and Code Quality
Your project will also be graded based on the following:

Use of Git and Github
Strong documentation
Clean and modular code

==Project Details==

Below are additional details about each component and tips to get you started.

Data Pipelines: Jupyter Notebooks
We've provided Jupyter notebooks in Project Workspaces with instructions to get you started with both data pipelines. The Jupyter notebook is not required for submission, but highly recommended to complete before getting started on the Python script.

Project Workspace - ETL
The first part of your data pipeline is the Extract, Transform, and Load process. Here, you will read the dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database. We expect you to do the data cleaning with pandas. To load the data into an SQLite database, you can use the pandas dataframe .to_sql() method, which you can use with an SQLAlchemy engine.

Feel free to do some exploratory data analysis in order to figure out how you want to clean the data set. Though you do not need to submit this exploratory data analysis as part of your project, you'll need to include your cleaning code in the final ETL script, process_data.py.

Project Workspace - Machine Learning Pipeline
For the machine learning portion, you will split the data into a training set and a test set. Then, you will create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that uses the message column to predict classifications for 36 categories (multi-output classification). Finally, you will export your model to a pickle file. After completing the notebook, you'll need to include your final machine learning code in train_classifier.py.

Data Pipelines: Python Scripts
After you complete the notebooks for the ETL and machine learning pipeline, you'll need to transfer your work into Python scripts, process_data.py and train_classifier.py. If someone in the future comes with a revised or new dataset of messages, they should be able to easily create a new model just by running your code. These Python scripts should be able to run with additional arguments specifying the files used for the data and model.

Example:
```
python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db

python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl
```
Templates for these scripts are provided in the Resources section, as well as the Project Workspace IDE. The code for handling these arguments on the command line is given to you in the templates.

Flask App
In the last step, you'll display your results in a Flask web app. We have provided a workspace for you with starter files. You will need to upload your database file and pkl file with your model.

This is the part of the project that allows for the most creativity. So if you are comfortable with html, css, and javascript, feel free to make the web app as elaborate as you would like.

In the starter files, you will see that the web app already works and displays a visualization. You'll just have to modify the file paths to your database and pickled model file as needed.

There is one other change that you are required to make. We've provided code for a simple data visualization. Your job will be to create two additional data visualizations in your web app based on data you extract from the SQLite database. You can modify and copy the code we provided in the starter files to make the visualizations.

Github and Code Quality
Throughout the process, make sure to push your code and comments to Github so that you will not repeat your work and you can keep track of the changes you've made. This will also help you keep your code modular and well documented. Make sure to include effective comments and docstrings. These software engineering practices will improve your communication and collaboration in the future when you work within a team.

Starter Code
The coding for this project can be completed using the Project Workspace IDE provided. Here's the file structure of the project:
```
- app
| - template
| |- master.html  # main page of web app
| |- go.html  # classification result page of web app
|- run.py  # Flask file that runs app

- data
|- disaster_categories.csv  # data to process 
|- disaster_messages.csv  # data to process
|- process_data.py
|- InsertDatabaseName.db   # database to save clean data to

- models
|- train_classifier.py
|- classifier.pkl  # saved model 

- README.md
```
Running the Web App from the Project Workspace IDE
When working in the Project Workspace IDE, here is how to see your Flask app.

Open a new terminal window. You should already be in the workspace folder, but if not, then use terminal commands to navigate inside the folder with the run.py file.

Type in the command line:
```
python run.py
```
Your web app should now be running if there were no errors.

Now, open another Terminal Window.

Type
```
env|grep WORK
```
You'll see output that looks something like this:


In a new web browser window, type in the following:
```
https://SPACEID-3001.SPACEDOMAIN
```
In this example, that would be: "https://viewa7a4999b-3001.udacity-student-workspaces.com/" (Don't follow this link now, this is just an example.)

Your SPACEID might be different.

You should be able to see the web app. The number 3001 represents the port where your web app will show up. Make sure that the 3001 is part of the web address you type in.

Rubric
Follow the RUBRIC when you work on your project to assure you meet all of the necessary criteria for developing the pipelines and web app.
 
### Project: Recommendations with IBM
Introduction
For this project you will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.


Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, you will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by creating an account on the platform here.

Your Tasks
Your project will be divided into the following tasks

I. Exploratory Data Analysis

Before making recommendations of any kind, you will need to explore the data you are working with for the project. Dive in to see what you can find. There are some basic, required questions to be answered about the data you are working with throughout the rest of the notebook. Use this space to explore, before you dive into the details of your recommendation system in the later sections.

II. Rank Based Recommendations

To get started in building recommendations, you will first find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. Since there are no ratings for any of the articles, it is easy to assume the articles with the most interactions are the most popular. These are then the articles we might recommend to new users (or anyone depending on what we know about them).

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, we could look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. This would be a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users. You will implement this next.

IV. Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)

Given the amount of content available for each article, there are a number of different ways in which someone might choose to implement a content based recommendations system. Using your NLP skills, you might come up with some extremely creative ways to develop a content based recommendation system. You are encouraged to complete a content based recommendation system, but not required to do so to complete this project.

V. Matrix Factorization

Finally, you will complete a machine learning approach to building recommendations. Using the user-item interactions, you will build out a matrix decomposition. Using your decomposition, you will get an idea of how well you can predict new articles an individual might interact with (spoiler alert - it isn't great). You will finally discuss which methods you might use moving forward, and how you might test how well your recommendations are working for engaging users.

Before you submit your work, check the RUBRIC to make sure you meet all of the rubric items.
